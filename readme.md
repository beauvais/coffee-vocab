# Coffee Vocab
---

**This is very much a work in progress.**

This is an effort to provide a machine-readable description of the topic of coffee.

The aim is to create a comprehensive—but ultimately useful—description of coffee from the plant, through the production and roasting, and to the cup.

# Notes

Coffee is a more difficult concept to map than I thought it would be, because it is fundamentally several entities:

	* The genus: coffea
	* The product (as beans)
	* A commodity
	* A beverage

They share a simple link: the product of a plant from genus *coffea*, but are used and described very differently.

The next steps I have in mind are:

* to complete a working description of coffea for production
	* species (e.g. *coffea arrabica* and *coffea robusta*)
	* varietals (e.g. bourbon)
	* countries of origin
		* country identified using another vocabulary (e.g. CIA World Factbook, DBPedia)
		* coffee-producing regions (e.g. Yrgacheffe within Ethiopia)
* to work on a description of production processes
	* define what it means to produce (i.e. differentiate between producing the beans as a product from preparing or brewing a beverage from the beans)
	* identify production methods which affect the consumers' decision:
		* Shade-grown
		* Organic
		* Decaffeination processes
		* Sun-dried
		* Honey-processed
		* Roasted
			* *some kind* of roasting company profile (e.g. commodity, speciality, micro-roasted, home-roasted)
			* roasting profiles (? difficult to define)
			* kind of roaster used (e.g. drum roaster)
* etc (keep going :)

The vocabulary should cover aspects relating to the differences between what people consume at the end. So, if a difference of varietal is important to the kind of coffee beans bought, it should be included as a class. If something is too esoteric to affect the beans bought by a consumer, it might be a good idea to avoid it, or leave it to later. For me, an example would be soil conditions for a field in the farm: although important to the farmer and roaster, encoding these details might not help a retailer or consumer.
